more practise making web pages/ home page and learning to use github

my name is stephen im 24 from sheffield , I have learnt some basic web design code on khan accademy and so far completed the javascript basics course which uses the JSproccessing libary and the Html/css basics course , right now they have a course on imbedding javascript into webpages so my next goal is to learn how to do that. I started learning to code about 3 months ago in my spare time and I have learnt a tone, however it does feel like its a huge learning curve and I have a long way to go, but thats part of the fun I guess, If I ever get bored learning one consept or language there is always something else I can learn about. If anyone has any (free) web resorces that could help me out that they could recommend that would be ace! Also if anyone knows about any books on coding they could reccomend Id love that too. 

Also spelling is not my strong point as you might have nocticed, please be nice. 

I can't wait to learn more code and become a part of github.
